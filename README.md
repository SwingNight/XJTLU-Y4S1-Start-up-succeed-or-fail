# XJTLU-Y4S1-Start-up-succeed-or-fail
The goal of the project was to predict if a start-up will succeed or fail based on a set of
data. We used Kaggle competition "Can you predict if a start-up will succeed or fail? " (see
https://www.kaggle.com/c/int303-big-data-analysis/data) to retrieve necessary data and
evaluate accuracy of our predictions. The historical data has been split into two groups, a
'training set' and a 'test set'. For the training set, we are provided with the outcome
(whether or not a start-up survived). We used this set to build our model to generate
predictions for the test set. For each start-up in the test set, we had to predict whether or
not a startup is ‘acquired’ by some other organization, means the startup succeed. Our score
was the percentage of correctly predictions.
